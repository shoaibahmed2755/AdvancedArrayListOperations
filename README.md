# Advanced ArrayList Operations in Java

## Description

This Java program demonstrates advanced operations on an `ArrayList` of integers. It includes adding elements, removing elements, sorting in both ascending and descending order, converting the `ArrayList` to an array, and additional features like finding the maximum and minimum values and shuffling the `ArrayList`.

## Features

- Adding elements to the `ArrayList`.
- Removing elements by value.
- Sorting the `ArrayList` in ascending and descending order.
- Converting the `ArrayList` to an array.
- Finding the maximum and minimum values in the `ArrayList`.
- Shuffling the elements of the `ArrayList`.

## Usage

To run the program, compile and execute the `ABC` class.

### Compilation

```bash
javac ABC.java


Sample_OutPut -->
Original ArrayList:
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
ArrayList after removing 4:
[1, 2, 3, 5, 6]
Sorted ArrayList:
[1, 2, 3, 5, 6]
ArrayList sorted in reverse order:
[6, 5, 3, 2, 1]
Array obtained from ArrayList:
6 5 3 2 1 
Maximum value in the ArrayList: 6
Minimum value in the ArrayList: 1
Shuffled ArrayList:
[2, 1, 6, 3, 5]
